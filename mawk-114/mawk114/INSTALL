how to install mawk on Unix like OS
--------------------

STEP 0:  Read the file UCONFIG.  If your system is there or
something close enough you only need run

       build_mawk  your_system  [CC=your_compiler]

	
(Build_mawk is a shell script with a first line of #!/bin/sh ; on 
some systems, csh users may need to

	/bin/sh build_mawk your_system [CC=your_compiler]
)


Build_mawk will produce from Makefile.in a Makefile for your_system
and then execute make which will make the mawk executable.

	make install

is a separate step with user settable macros for the target
directories inside the Makefile.

how to install on a new system
------------------------------

STEP 1:
You need to link or copy a .h file in mawk/config, that describes your 
configuration, to the mawk directory and name it config.h.  

First look at the file mawk/config/generic.h.  This file describes the 
most common situations.  If it describes your machine and system, then 
use it.  If not, you need to make a .h for your system.  You only need 
to make defines that describe how you differ from the description in 
generic.h.  The other .h's in config should serve as sufficient 
examples.  Also look at template.h 

STEP2:
In the mawk directory, run build_mawk MF.  This will give you a
generic Makefile which you can adjust the user macros.

STEP3:
Run make.  If mawk successfully compiles, two tests will be run on mawk.
The first, in the shell script test/mawk_test, will see if mawk is 
running correctly under normal conditions and the second, test/fpe_test,
will produce floating point exceptions to see if mawk handles things 
like division by zero correctly.  

Failing the first test means your source files are corrupted,
or mawk has a bug uncovered by the new environment.

Failing the second means adjustments need to be made to floating point 
definitions in your config.h.  


If you make a new config.h or add a new machine to an existing config.h,
send me the new or cdiffs for the old.  If things just won't work, send 
me the config.h and the error messages and I'll try to figure out what's
wrong.
