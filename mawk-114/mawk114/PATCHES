patch4:  mawk1.1.3 -> mawk1.1.4   May 93

fixed 2 bugs:
1)  length alone without () or ($0) sometimes core dumps due
    to stupid oversight in parse.y

2)  numeric looking data fields that fpe overflow cause program
    to halt -- should be treated as strings instead


patch3:  mawk1.1.2 -> mawk1.1.3   Jan 93

1) New configurations:
   hpux coherent 386bsd linux

2) Changed some ints to longs so that Unix and Dos versions
   give same output.  E.g.,

   printf "%d" and printf "%ld" are now the same on Dos.

   msdos/examples directory with scripts by Ben Myers

   Infinity+1 large model pointer bug caused by modulo 2^16
   arithmetic fixed.

3) Grossly surprised to discover  (int) d causes a floating
   point exception on hpux when d is a large double.
   Integer casts are now done more carefully.  Thanks to
   Ken Poulton for finding this bug.

4) Removed ApolloSR10.3 from working configurations. Mawk will
   not work if compiled with CC6.8.


patch2:  mawk1.1.1 -> mawk1.1.2   26 Aug 92

1)  Comparisons are done as described the AWK book, which is the
    same as mawk1.0.  Evidently I lack the requisite mental facilities
    to understand posix comparisons , i.e.

      echo 0 | mawk '$0 == "0000" { print "true" }'
      true

    was a major bozo.

2)  If n = split(s, X, r) , then all elements other than
    X[1..n] are now deleted from X.  This behavior is 
    consistent with other awks.

3)  foo = "foo"
    foo++ evaluates to 0 and value of foo is 1

    old behavior was foo++ was "foo" and foo then set to 1

4)  Fixed two bugs in regular expression lexical scanner:

    [c1-c2] did not work right if c2 was an escaped character.

    function do_str() which collected runs of characters did
    not work right if the last character was escaped and the run
    ended with * + or ?.

5)  You can now read and write to the same file.  E.g.

    printf "Enter:  " > "/dev/tty"
    getline answer < "/dev/tty"

6)  Output to files which are ttys is now unbuffered.

7)  FILENAME and FNR retain their value from the last record in
    the END section.  

8)  man pages might groff.

9)  New configuration files
	aix.h  convex.h  sysVr4i386.h

10) Better error recovery for bungled function definitions
    via new productions

    program_block : outside_error block ;
    error : outside_error ;

11) If i > NF , then ++$i , $i++, g?sub(r,s,$i), now work
    correctly.

12) MsDOS, interactive input: terminating a line with ^Z
    works correctly (at least with TC++ compiler).

l3) string_buff had too many users which induced an error in
    sprintf().  After parsing, string_buff is now only be used
    by sprintf().
    (Old fart seduced by subliminal common block).

--------------------------------------------------
patch1:  mawk1.1 to mawk1.1.1     (mar 92)

1) fixed bug which caused 

	mawk 'program'  var=value

without files on the command line to sporadically fail.

2) fixed bug which caused

	getline <=

to be mistaken for input redirection.

3) Changed rexp1.c to work around a bug in sun SC1.0 compiler.

4) Minor improvements to build_mawk script.

5) changed the name of ultrix42_mips.h to ultrix42mips.h so
   the filename is 14 characters.

6) printf() and sprintf() can now have more arguments than 
conversions in the format string.  This allows a "poor man's" varargs
functionality for user functions that do output.

7) new configurations:

      next, sgi, aix

8) removed HAVE_PRINTF_HD define as too obscure to be useful.

9) added missing config/apollo.h file.
