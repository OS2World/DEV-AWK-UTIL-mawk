The port of mawk to the Mac is the work of an anonymous
reviewer for comp.sources.reviewed.

The parse.c and parse.h provided in the distribution won't
work because the data exceeds 32K, so you need to make
parse.c with a different yacc parser.  Options and how
to do it are in the unix Makefile.

(The parse.c in 1.1 might work as the data is smaller.  I
don't have access to MAC.  Feedback on this is welcome.)


system() and pipes are missing from MacMAWK.
